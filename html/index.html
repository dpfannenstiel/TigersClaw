		<p>Now Hear This: Words from the Editor</p>
		<p>Space is a near-vacuum, as all good Academy graduates and msot two-year-old children know. And if you ask, "If I drop a pebble into space like I do into a pool of water, will it cause ripples?" you'll get some strange looks from everyone.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, someone dropped a pebble in space not too long ago, and we're still encountering the ripples.</p>
		<p>Last month, two very good pilots (Lt. Larry Dibbles and Captain R. A. Skinner) went out on a routine mission and didn't come back. Here in Vega Sector, it happens all the time. You sit for awhile; you look at your pal's empty bunk; you think about where he's goine and hope you won't soon follow his lead; you probably get drunk. Then it's back to work.</p>
		<p>Yes, it happens all the time. But it's been happening a <em>lot</em> lately - and not just routine casualties, but casualties caused by sloppiness, over-eagerness, and a variety of other fatal diseases. The ship's statistical resources show that avoidable casualties are up 5% over thsi time last year... and are up 9% over expected optimum performance. So, we're seeing ripples.</p>
		<p><i>Here's one ripple:</i> Two pilots ae gone and won't be back.</p>
		<p><i>Another:</i> This issue, we've asked one of the most experienced pilots, Major James Taggart (aka Paladin on the flightline) to talk about The Basics: Basic tactics, goals, and maneuvers. Even if you're sure you know The Basics, read what he has to say, and remember that Paladin is still going strong after twenty-plus years as a combat jockey... and even if he doesn't wear his Ace of Aces ribbon, its still there.</p>
		<p><i>Another:</i> You won't be seeing <i>Hornet's Nest</i> - a carrier wich bore an unfortuante and unmistakable resemblance to the <i>Tiger's Claw</i> - were the product of an artist and pilot who went by the moniker of Tooner. We like to remember Tooner as having a deft wit and a diseased mind, but all we can do <em>is</em> remember him. He was also known as Lt. Larry Dibbles. R. I. P.</p>
		<p><i>Then, it's back to work.</i> Also in this issue, we have the latest Vega Sector update from <i>Joan's Fighting Spacecraft</i> including the most up-to-date data on the Kilrathi ships we're facing; an excerpt form Borger's new survey of Terran and Kilrathi weapon systems; and our usual assortment of news, facts, trivia, and profiles. Enjoy them... but think about them.</p>
