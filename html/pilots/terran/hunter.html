	<p>Captain Ian St. John, or <i>Hunter</i> to the spacecrews, is one of the best pilots in the service, and has racked up an impressive number of kills in the years he has been stationed on the <i>Tiger's Claw</i>.
	He's known as a seat-of-the-pants filer, and Kilrathi opponents tend to be baffled by his unpredictable, spontaneous flying style.</p>
	<p>The 27-year-old native of Brisbane, Australia is sometimes accuse fo excessive independence and a casual attitude toward regulations.  "Maybe so," he explains, "but I'd never leave my wing leader hanging. However, every [expleive deleted] thing we're given - ships, weapons, training, an' standing regs - is there for us to push to the limit, an' maybe a little further, if we're going to get the job done. Notice I say 'push to the limit' not 'break.' Maybe there's not much of a difference, but it's usually <em>the</em> difference between dusting a furball an' sucking vacuum."</p>
