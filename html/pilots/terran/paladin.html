	<p>Rank: Major</p>
	<p>Callsign: Paladin</p>
	<p>Tag: A Professional's Professional</p>
	<p>"The laddies coming out of the Academy think I was born old," says Major James Taggart, who is known as <i>Paladin</i> to the spacecrews. "But when I took my commission - not too long after we <em>discovered</em> the Empire of Kilrah - I was just a kid. I was charged up on stories of knight-errantry, on <i>The Death of Arthur</i> and <i>The Song of Roland</i>. So when we ran into the Kilrathi, I knew I was going to grab up a lance, hop into a cockpit, and change the course of history. Naturally," he jokes, "I did."</p>
	<p>Taggart, 45, is a native or Ares, the self-sufficient space station built in permanent orbit around the planet Venus; his parents were terraforming engineers from Wick, Scotland.</p>
	<p>Though an effective wingleader, Taggart is especialy appreciated for his wingman skills. He has a reputation for protectiveness when flying wing. On an average of three times a year, pranksters get to his space-craft, and scrape the name "Paladin" from his cockpit and replace it with "Mother Hen."</p>
	<p>"Appreciate it while you can," he grins. "Combat flying is a young man's game, and I'm having trouble convincing the medics that I'm still 25. I'll be flying a desk before too long... if I can find one with afterburners and smart missiles."</p>
