	<p>Major Chen Kien is known as <em>Bossman</em> to the spacecrews, but that wasn't always the case, "When I was young - er, younger - they called me <em>Ripper</em>; my old friends still do. I was a lot like Hunter, pushing everything to the limit. But I might have been a little too good, or at least lucky, at it. Replacement crews coming in, bright young second looies, took my lead... and got themselves shot to hell. When I started burying young pilots who had been killed for behaving like me, I decided to give them an example that would not get them blown out of space. It is sort of a viscious cycle: You try and act as an example, and young pilots start coming to you for advice. That is when they started calling me Bossman. I do not regret all these changes... but ehre are times I miss the old days."</p>
	<p>The 39-year-old native of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, has a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Confederation Net university system. He is married to an ergonomics engineer, Chen Mingxing, and, last March, became the father of a baby girl.
