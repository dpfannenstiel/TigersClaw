	<p>Tag: Reliability Under Fire</p>
	<p>Captain Joseph Khumalo, known to the crews as <i>Knight</i>, admits that his piloting accomplishments don't dot the record books. "Im not a cockpit genius like Hunter or a marksman like Angel. I'm an ordinary man. I'm a pilot. It's my job."</p>
	<p>Yet wingleaders tend to breathe a sigh of relief when they draw Khumalo as wingman. Knight has a reputation of utter reliability in combat. "I got my nickname in the Enyo Engagement. The Kilrathi were swarming like flies. I was a second looie assigned as wingman to Captain Maria 'la Do&ntilde;a' Alvarez. We were hugging the deck of this transport and strafing it, did a tight turn going from it's back to it's belly, and ran right through a swarm of fighers headed the other way. And efensive maneuvering in those quarters would've cut me off from la Do&ntilde;a, so I just fired as fast as I could, and got lucky: I was an ace coming out of that pack, and I picked off a couple of fighers going after my wingleader. La Do&ntilde;a put on her thickest accent and said, 'Ooh, eet's my White Knight,' and the name stuck. </p>
	<p>"But, honestly, I don't feel that way, I'm not a knight-errant. I'm a soldier. Not all of us can be geniuses... but I'm going to do the best I can with what I can," Khumalo, 36, hails from Kroonstad, South Africa.</p>
