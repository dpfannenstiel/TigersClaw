	<p>Name: Tanaka Marike</p>
	<p>Rank: 1st Lt</p>
	<p>Callsign: Spirit</p>
	<p>Tag: The Unstoppable Force</p>
	<p>1st Lt. Tanaka Marike goes by the tag of <i>Spirit</i> - a rough translation of <i>Kami</i>, as she's called by the Jampanese pilot instructors responsible for her initial training. In the cockpit, Spirit is known for her deceptive, defensive piloting; her ability to sense and avoid incoming fire; and her habit of creeping in as close as possible to a target before cutting loose with ship's weaponry.</p>
	<p>A native of Sapporo on the Japanese island of Hokkaido, Tanaka is a thrid-generation military pilot.  Her father, Major Tanaka Shun (accectionately remembered as <i>Go-Devil</i>), died twenty years ago in the brutal McAuliffe Ambush of '34.</p>
	<p>The 24-year-old ace explains, "I did not join the armed forces for revenge. I have no fantasies of personally gunning down the pilot who killed my father. It is a matter of tradition and duty. The tradition is my family's and the duty is to the Earth... I am often asked if I think of myself as a modern <em>samurai</em>. The answer is no. I am a military pilot, not a feudal retainer. But there is nothing to keep a modern pilot, Japanese or not, from trying to adhere to the best elements of the warrior-codes of the past: The code of the samurai, the code of th knight-errant, any code of honor and service."</p>
