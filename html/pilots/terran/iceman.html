	<p>Major Michael Casey, or <em>Iceman</em> to the crews, ahs racked up more confirmed kills whil serving on the <em>Tiger's Claw</em> than any other pilot in the carrier's history. In the cockpit, he his known for a calm under fire, letter-perfect flying technique, and a deadly aim with ship's weapons, a combination which guarantees disaster for Kilrathi opponents.</p>
	<p>Angel, frequent wingman for Iceman, describes flying with him: "You mush learn to listen for Iceman. On the comm unit, in a large engagement, everyone is either shouting or at least very excitable; Iceman is <em>whispering</em>. You have to strain your ears to hear him. It's always ters little statements: 'Moving in.' 'Rolling right.' 'Target in sight.' 'Objectgive accomplished.' 'Head for home.' And I will tell you: He talks ten times as much in the cockpit as he ever talks on the carrier." Iceman is 31, a native of Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
