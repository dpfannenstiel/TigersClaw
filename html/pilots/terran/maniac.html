	<p>Tag: New Kid on the Block</p>
	<p>Fresh from the Academy is 2nd Lt. Todd Marshall, known as <em>Maniac</em> by his graduating class.</p>
	<p>Marshall, 23, tries hard to live up to his moniker. "Plodding along with your joystick in one hand anda  copy of the naval regs in the other is not going to impress the Kilrathi," he says. "They know our regs. They know the Book, they know how we do things. If we're going to put them on the ropes, we have to adapt our rules, tactics, and flying styles. We ahve to outfly them, outfight them... we've got to <em>want</em> it more. And I want it.</p>
	<p>"I'm a Proxie - world Leto, Proxima Centauri IV. When the colonization started, anyone with any brains or skills high tailed it off Earth, and most of them ended up on Leto. That's why Proxies kick homeborn Terrans around in the ratings."</p>
	<p>Despite his creative interpretation of colonial history and comparative Naval Academy standings, Marshall was one of the highest-rated Academy graduates of the '54 class and promises to be a worthy addition to the <em>Tiger's Claw</em> pilot roster.</p>
