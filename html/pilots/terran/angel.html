	<p>"I cannot stand 'rebels,' or hot-doggers, or any of these so-called intuitive knot it alls," explains Captain Jeannette Devereaux, who goes by the cockpit moniker of <i>Angel</i>. "We have used flying craft in warfare since 1914. As a race, we have nearly <em>eight centuries</em> of combat flying experience, and we've had nearly eight centuries to define, refine, and perfect the rules by which we fly. These are rules designed to keep us alive, keep our wingmen alive, and win out wars, <i>n'est-ce pas</i>?</p>
	<p>"But every class that comes out of the Academy is stuffed full of these talented fliers who think that, because they can do new and interesting things with their machines, they must be smarted than eight centuries of military thinkers... and so the rules don't apply to them. They shut up fast when they start seeing their classmates eat missiles... and it is at <em>that</em> point they join the human race and begin to contribute to winning this war."</p>
	<p>The 28-year-old Deveraux is a native of Brussels, Belgium. She is widely known for her marksmanship: Her accomplishments with ship's weapons dot the <i>Tiger's Claw</i> performance records.</p>
