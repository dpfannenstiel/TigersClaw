	<p>Name: Khajja the Fang</p>
	<p>Handle: The Machine</p>
	<p>Starcraft: <i>Krant</i>-Class Medium Fighter</p>
	<p>Khajja the Fang is not-so-affectionately called "the Machine" by Terran intelligence. He is the most efficient, mission-oriented pilot the Kilrathi have. He pilots a <i>Krant</i>-Class Medium Fighter.</p>
	<p><b>Strengths:</b> Khajja's greatest asset is his clear thinking. He never panics or falters and appears to have utter confidence in his wingmen. He is not vulnerable to taunts, goads, or insults.</p>
	<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Khajja's faith in his wingmen may be misplaced. Analysis indicates that some Kilrathi pilots may be afraid of him. He will single-mindedly ignore incoming ships to concentrate on a strike objective, meaning that he might ignore <em>you</em>.</p>
	<p><b>Tactics:</b> Khajja prefers straight-in, straight-out strafing approaches. He uses is laser cannon for most encounters, saves his heat-seekers for mission objectives or particularly troublesome enemies, and saves his friend or foe missiles for emergencies.</p>
	<p><b>Recommendation:</b> If he's approachinga mission objective, you might get a free shot by eluding his wingmen. If he's moving in on you, utilize classic dogfight tactics: Try to outfly and outshoot him, or lead him toward unengaged friendlies. He doesn't like bad odds.</p>
