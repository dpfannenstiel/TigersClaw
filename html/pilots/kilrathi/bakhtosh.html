	<p>Name: Bakhtosh</p>
	<p>Handle: Redclaw</p>
	<p>Starcraft: <i>Jalthi</i>-Class Heavy Fighter</p>
	<p>Bakhtosh Redclaw is a rash on the comm units; he is best-known for extremely sarcastic gloating during combat engagements. It appears that he belongs to an aristocratic Kilrathi family and has been trained in the politic of the superiority from birth. He flies a <i>Jalthi</i>-Class Heavy Fighter.</p>
	<p><b>Strengths:</b> Bakhtosh is the best kilrathi shot in Vega Sector, bar none. His accuracy with ship's guns is becoming legendary even among Terran pilots, which is another strength: Some Terrans feel intimidated when confronting the legendary Bakhtosh, and consequently their flying suffers. Additionally, he is a master of the crowning insult, the patronizing remark, and the racial slur. He often goads Terran fighters into bad tactical errors.</p>
	<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Bakhtosh's piloting is nothing special. Like one legendary figure of Terran combat aviation, the Red Baron, he is an excellent marksman but a mediocre flier. Additionally, his insults and better-than-thou attitude are <em>not</em>; he believes himself to be superior to all Kilrathi as well as humans.</p>
	<p><b>Tactics:</b> Bakhtosh prefers to fire at a distance. He will get the maximum effective range for his weapons and chew his target to pieces. The extra distance allows him a little time to cope with the maneuvers of superior fliers. If forced to close with a foe, he will launch one of his missiles.</p>
	<p><b>Recommendation:</b> Close, firing continuously, then try to outfly him in standard fashion. Do <em>not</em> be daunted by his substantial reputation.</p>
