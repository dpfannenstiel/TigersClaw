	<p>Name: Bhurak</p>
	<p>Handle: Starkiller</p>
	<p>Starcraft: <i>Salthi</i>-Class Light Fighter</p>
	<p>Best-known among the Kilrathi aces is Bhurak, called Bhurak Starkiller. He is regarded as teh best living pilot among the Kilrathi in this sector. He flies a <i>Salthi</i>-Class Light Fighter.</p>
	<p><b>Strengths:</b> Bhurak's and excellent pilot and shot. He has optimal reflexes and there are no serious weaknesses to be detected in his flying style.</p>
	<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Psych profiles indicate that Bhurak is probably addicted to speed, thrills, and sport. Though a courageous pilot, he is not without a survival instinct: A sufficient number of opponents or a sudden turn in fortune could panic him into retreat.</p>
	<p><b>Tactics:</b> Bhurak likes the dogfight. He prefers a maneuverable foe and standard dogfight tactics. He almost always uses his ship's laser cannon, reserving his standard dumb-fire missile for stationary targets.</p>
	<p><b>Recommendation:</b> If possible, put several pilots on him at once; deny him a fair fight or anything he would consider fun. He might become disgruntled and choose another target, or rout. If you're forced into single combat with him, don't try to outfly him: You might do best by going stationary, spinning to keep him in your sights, and trading licks. He doesn't appear to consider that fun and may choose a new objective.</p>
