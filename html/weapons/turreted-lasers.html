	<p><strong>Turreted Lasers</strong> - Terran and Kilrathi destroyers, cruisers, dreadnaughts, carriers, and bases are equipped with heavy, turreted lasers linked to advanced tarfeting systems. Only the most maneuverable ships have any chance of surviving concentrated fire from these formidable weapons.</p>
