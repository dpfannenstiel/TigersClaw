	<p><strong>Dumb-Fire Missile</strong> - The Dumb-Fire missile is a point-and-shoot weapon - just aim it at a target and hope the target can't get out of the way. With no homing capability, the Dumb-Fire is most effective in the hands of a pilot who can anticipate the target's reacons. When possible, it should be reserved for use in close quarters or against slow-moving targets.</p>
