	<p><strong>Procupine Mines</strong> - These dealy devices have limited homing capability and built-in proximity sensors - detonation doesn't require contact. If there's a Kilrathi on your tail, just open your rear doors and drop a Procupine in his path. He'll be off your tail in no time. Or he'll be dead... If you ever see one of these irregular spheres tumbling your way, punch the throttle and steer clear.</p>
