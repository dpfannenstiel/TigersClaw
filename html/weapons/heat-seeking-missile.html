	<p><strong>Heat-Seekign Missile</strong> - The engines of a modern space fighter or capial ship generate a lot of heat, a fact the heat-seeking missile uses to great advantage. All a pilot has to do is park himself on an enemy's tail, wait for the heat-seeker to lock, and then fire. (NOTE: If the target shakes the heat seeker, the missile locks onto the nearest heat source, perhaps even the ship tha toriginally fired it!)</p>
