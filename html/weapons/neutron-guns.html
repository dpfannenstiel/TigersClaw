	<p><strong>Neutron Guns</strong> - Neutron guns do heavy damage, but only at close range. No other projectile weapon provides an equivalent level of destructive capability. The down side is that neutron guns heat up rapidly and eat up power at an alarming rate. Also, the neutron gun's lack of range has led many fool-hardy or underskilled pilots inot close-quarter combat for which they were ill-prepared. Some of those pilots never made it home.</p>
