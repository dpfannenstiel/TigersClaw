A simple web site based on information about Wing Commander.

I don't own most of this.
Let me say that at the start.
I was a big fan of the Wing Commander series in my youth.
Now as a thirty-something I found it again on GOG and got to playing it.
It's still fun.

I'm putting this together because I'm interested in learning more about web development and having content content makes that easier.
I'm going to do my level best to document my sources.
If you think I've appropriated some of you work, please open an issue.
I'll do my best to resolve it promptly.

If you're the publisher of the game, I hope you'll accept this as the labor of love that it is.

Thanks.
